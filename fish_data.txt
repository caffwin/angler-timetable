# Considerations for handling mooching:
#   Assign the keyword "Mooch" as the bait 
    # Search separate "mooch_data.txt" file for data to return to user

#   Include the name of the fish in fish_bait column > re-query for all rows where is_mooch = True
    #   Search through these, find matching name and return helpful attributes/info for this row

# How to handle mooch fish coming from different locations/worlds? Include columns or set to None?
# Are mooch and regular fish attributes so different to the point where it makes sense to 
# create another data set?

# Mooch fish are commons - just assume that if bait is an existing fish (aka mooch), it's available 
# in the same area?
# Every single mooch fish is available in the same area since they need to be chained,
# so this seems like a good idea. There is no instance of a mooch being from a different location.
# Could it be helpful to list all locations for that specific?
# Users will rarely look for mooch fish locations, and are only interested in the big fish. 

# If wanting to be specific, locations can still be listed in an array, this data just needs to be
# accurate, otherwise mooch fish may not show up in searches


# Should area and world be included in this data set? 
# Create a separate list of all worlds, areas and locations and join to find specific species
